# Textual-Minesweeper

This is textual version of popular game Minesweeper.

Now you can play the game on your job even if sysadmins deleted
all the games before you got your computer :)

If you find some typos or bugs please don't hesitate to report them.

The only purpose of all my code here is training, so it is free of charge
and can be used "as is" or modified in any way.
